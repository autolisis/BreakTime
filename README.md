# BreakTime
Forces you to take breaks every x minutes (inspired by TakeABreak for Linux)

### Intended Audience
Most break programs are built for people who just need a gentle nudge to take a break. For me, however, once I get into something, I have too much inertia and it's very hard to switch gears. 

This app doesn't try to gently nudge you away from unhealthy work habits. It doesn't make a sweet, timid suggestion that, maybe wouldn't it be a good idea to take a break? I would just ignore something like that.

This app generously permits you to work during work time, and **forbids** you from doing anything to your computer during break time.

### Platforms
- [x] Windows
- [x] Linux (WIP)
- [ ] MacOS (need tester)


### Pre-requisites
You need Python 3 installed on your machine.

### Setup
Clone this repository (or download it as a zip and extract to a directory).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reisub0/BreakTime
```

Then, navigate to the directory and execute
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
Now to use this script, all you have to do is navigate to the directory and launch the `launch.cmd` script.

### Configuration
To change the work and break time, you can edit the respective variables in `launch.cmd`
